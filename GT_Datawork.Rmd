```{r library, echo = T}
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(RCurl)

```


```{r data import, echo = F}
read.csv()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
